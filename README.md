Two Web-Based Applications - University Courses List and University Courses.

University Courses List - A lightweight web-based application that implements HTML, CSS, Javascript and JSON to return a list of university courses. The courses are stored in a JSON file, fetched using Javascript and displayed on the HTML page which is in turn styled with CSS. The application also has an integrated currency converter that converts the base currency British Pound (GBP) to four (4) other currencies - United States Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR) and Mauritian Rupees (MUR).

University Courses - An improved web appication based off the 'University Courses List' web application. University courses has a database of courses which contains modules linked to individual courses via a 'one-to-many' relationship that uses the course code as the foreign key. The application features a login page which ensures a level of security throughtout the application. The application also includes the feature of generating a course report for one or several courses. The further implementation of this project/application would be to represent or render the course report(s) with charts using the Chart.js Library
